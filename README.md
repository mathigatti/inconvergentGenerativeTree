Tree
=============

One of the first attempts I made at generative algorithms was a copy of [this](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/treeGarden/) great little
application. Recently I decided it was about time that I revisited this
project. As opposed to the algorithm in the link, my trees are generated pixel
by pixel. That is, there are no pre-drawn parts.

As you can see, if you examine the results a little, the trees take shapes that
er neither realistic nor possible. Yet they look very much like trees at first
glance.
